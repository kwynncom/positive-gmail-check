If I delete the encryption key cookies to the refresh and access tokens, Google cycles because my program thinks I have a working key but it doesn't 
decrypt.  Different devices will have different keys.  Have to ponder this one.

I can't key the database by address because there are too many sessions / devices.  

Best I can think is to use public private key.  The refresh token holding SID leaves an encrypted refresh token for SIDs that have proven they are 
the same address.  That is, it does so at the moment it has a cleartext refresh_token.

1/12 00:30 - It still doesn't quite work.  I need to remove the "$or" logic.  If an email matches, then erase other rows associated with the token, 
and / or erase no-address rows that are more than a few seconds old.  

First test email, then access_token.  

This is causing the loop if I don't erase the db entries upon revoke.

next day - 2023/01/11 23:28 - What I've been doing wrong for YEARS is not realizing that getAccessToken() fetched  a new one rather than getting it 
from memory. Update: an hour later - actually, maybe not.  It was the encryption with different keys that was part of the problem.

I think the logic needs to be that upon insert or update, if a row exists with a refresh key and another doesn't switch the sid to the 
	refresh row.  

// intentional mis-spellings; see note
remove dao reference in gmaiCli, gmailClient should call $client / OAutPoEma (intentionally misspelled so I don't find it in searches)
	 object for this
	the tokens in the database should be saved by refresh and access because that is what is unique.  
	A session_id can't authorize more than one email without confusion, but one email ...
	Actually, this needs more thought.  My logic doesn't seem quite right in any event.
	An email correlates to a refresh / access token, but I don't know the address at first.

plaintext emails are still going into usage
	conditionally anonymize them based on whether it's me or not, and / or give me an alias
	or give and alias feature

Clean up the usage table in terms of time formats and such.  Use the new library dao_generic_3

Add an indicator for the user as to whether refresh token or not (exists / system has)
