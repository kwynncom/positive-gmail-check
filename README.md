check GMail for unread messages, with certainty

This system requests Google OAUTH / OAUTH2 authority to access your GMail email metadata.  The purpose is to show a count of your unread emails.  I created 
this because, at the time, in late 2017 with Android 4.x, I could not trust a "pull" of email to show new messages.  Often I would pull and pull for hours
and not see messages on the GMail app.  I would have to use GMail.com for a reliable reading.  Given that pulling didn't work, "push" certainly didn't work 
for hours.

To this day (mid 2020 and Android 8.x), when a pull or push will show new emails is iffy, although the situation is much improved.   I've used this several 
to many times a day for 2.5 years (end of 2017 to mid 2020).  It works very near perfectly.  

I never really intended for anyone else to use it on my server (see below).  On one hand, you're welcome to.  On the other hand, I make no guarantees about 
it.  You're free to run your own copy.

With that said, it is running at https://kwynn.com/t/7/12/email/  .  It will immediately take you to an OAUTH screen.
