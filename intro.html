    <h1>GMail unread message checker</h1>
    
    <p>The Android GMail app's notification of new emails is / used to be unreliable, so I created this web app to solve that problem.  
        For that matter, 
        it was or still is unreliable at pulling new messages.  
        It was 
        definitely unreliable years ago (2017).  I haven't tested lately, but I am fairly sure there is still value in this web app.  I use it all 
        the time in early 2022.  Once I got it doing what I wanted, I saw no need to rely on the app.
    </p>
    
    <p>This (web) app pulls at your request, it does not push--that is, it does not notify.  It gives you a reliable count of unread messages when you 
        ask it.  
    </p>
    
    <p>The <a href='https://github.com/kwynncom/positive-gmail-check'>source code is on GitHub</a>, and you're welcome to run this on your 
        own server, so I don't have access to your "stuff."  If you proceed below, you'll be taken to Google and asked to give my app read-only, 
        metadata-only access to whichever GMail account you want to check.
