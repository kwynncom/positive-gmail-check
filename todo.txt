remove dao reference in gmailClient, gmailClient should call $client / OAuthPosEmail object for this
	the tokens in the database should be saved by refresh and access because that is what is unique.  
	A session_id can't authorize more than one email without confusion, but one email ...
	Actually, this needs more thought.  My logic doesn't seem quite right in any event.

plaintext emails are still going into usage
	conditionally anonymize them based on whether it's me or not, and / or give me an alias
	or give and alias feature

Clean up the usage table in terms of time formats and such.  Use the new library dao_generic_3

Add an indicator for the user as to whether refresh token or not (exists / system has)
